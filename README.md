## Quick Start

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### `yarn start`

Runs the project in development mode.  
You can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn start:prod`

Runs the compiled app in production.

You can again view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

### `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `yarn start -- --inspect`

To debug the node server, you can use `razzle start --inspect`. This will start the node server and enable the inspector agent. For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/).

### `yarn start -- --inspect-brk`

To debug the node server, you can use `razzle start --inspect-brk`. This will start the node server, enable the inspector agent and Break before user code starts. For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/).

### `rs`

If your application is running, and you need to manually restart your server, you do not need to completely kill and rebundle your application. Instead you can just type `rs` and press enter in terminal.
